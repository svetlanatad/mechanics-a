THere are too many clashes, so I will stop at this iteration

Some observations that I've made, is that  allowing more shifts helps resolve clashes by giving exams more flexibility to move to different timeslots, just gotta work on it more

After adding an autoassociator, and training


in .crs file 
there are course codes, and the last code is the number of courses we have

in .stu file
one line is one student and shows what courses has the students taken, for example, 
0001 0002
means the first student took 1st and 2nd courses

course array has n + 1 elements where the first element is not a course its a dummy course and we start index from 1 until n 

mySlot (slot index) = slot % 17 (modula, taking remainder)
force = num of courses it clashes with
continue is for when you do 10 iters but you wanna continue doing 100 more iters then you continue instead of starting all over again
Autoasasociator is the hopefield network
	fix continue button
2.2 gettimeSlot
int pattern[] = new int[n + 1] //n is length of course, 190
for(int i = 1; i <pattern.length(); i++)
	pattern[i] = courses.slot(i) == 1 ? 1 : -1;
CALculate average shit 381/17 ~ 22 and then x 0.5 = 11
the training data in total has to be 0.139 * 190 change shifts

the neural network 
diagonals are all 0
adjacency matrix in autoassociator is symmetric
weight(i,j) = pattern[i] * pattern [j] + weight(i,j);
dp this until 52 times ##this is the training method`
update()
1 cell update
timeslot -? pattern
update(neurons){
k=random(382)
dheck if the neuon value needsto be updated or no 
which means if 1 becomes -1 if -1 becomes 1 
how to decide? 
xk  = signium function (sum of weights * x until 381)
if (xk < 0) takes -1
else takes 1
full update not needed


WILL ADD UPDATES LATER

I thought of a method to make it better, I will add another training method, where I can use a mathematical function that will decide which chain update (or full update) is better to use, and after a long research, I think using a heuristic function based on the current state of the neurons and the training progress could be a lot better for the values,so please, give us more time to thoroughly work on the project, as it is very fun and interesting... I am just not managing within the progress deadline, but, I am certainly having progress from yesterday, I will add more log files soon... Thank you for understanding... please...
